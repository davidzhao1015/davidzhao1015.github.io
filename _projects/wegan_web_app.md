Our collaborative project aims to create a web-based software application automating data analysis for ecologists. It utilizes the robust R package ‘vegan’ within a modern JSF framework. The user-friendly interface allows biologists to analyze their data quickly and easily, even without programming or advanced statistical expertise, generating reproducible reports in minutes.
