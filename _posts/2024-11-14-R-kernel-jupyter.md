## Introduction

Jupyter Notebook is a web app for creating and sharing computational documents. By using an IDE like Visual Studio Code (VS Code), developers can run Jupyter Notebook on their local machines and take advantage of powerful extensions available in VS Code.

However, Jupyter Notebook and its extension in VS Code only support certain programming languages, such as Python, and not R—which I wanted to use for a blogging project.

After exploring solutions, including help from the programming community, ChatGPT 4.0, and trial and error, I found a way to run R code in Jupyter Notebook within VS Code. I’d like to share a step-by-step guide for others with the same need and explain the troubleshooting process behind it.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Install R Kernel in Jupyter Notebook

### 1. Verify R Installation
Ensure R is installed by checking its version:

```bash
R --version
```

### 2. Verify Jupyter Notebook Installation
Make sure Python is installed and accessible in your PATH. Then, check for Jupyter:

```bash
python --version
```

```bash
jupyter --version
```

To confirm Jupyter Notebook is working, run:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This should open a Jupyter Notebook in your web browser. If there are issues, install Jupyter using:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

### 3. Check if Jupyter Directory is in PATH
Ensure the Jupyter directory is included in your PATH:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

The PATH environment variable tells the system where to find executable files when you run a command.

### 4. Install `IRkernel` Package in R
Install the `IRkernel` package in R:

```r
install.packages('IRkernel')
```

### 5. Register R Kernel with Jupyter
Run the following command in your R terminal (not the interactive R console):

```r
IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE)
```

Setting `user = FALSE` makes the kernel available for all users. Use `user = TRUE` if you prefer a user-specific installation.

#### Common Error and Solution
If you encounter this error:

```
Error in IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE) :
jupyter-client has to be installed but “jupyter kernelspec --version” exited with code 127.
In addition: Warning message:
In system2("jupyter", c("kernelspec", "--version"), FALSE, FALSE) :
error in running command
```

Run the command in the R terminal instead of the R console to resolve it.

### 6. Create a New Jupyter Notebook in VS Code
Restart VS Code and create a new Jupyter Notebook. Select the R kernel to start coding in R within Jupyter Notebook.

## Additional Tips

- Install R Packages in Jupyter: You can install R packages directly in a Jupyter cell by using install.packages("package_name").
- Switch Between Python and R Kernels: If you want to mix Python and R code in a Jupyter Notebook, you can use rpy2, a package that allows for inter-language compatibility. Alternatively, you can use Jupyter Lab with extensions that allow cell-specific kernel selection.

This setup allows you to use Jupyter Notebooks with R code, which can be particularly useful for data analysis, visualization, and sharing work with others who use Python or Jupyter Notebooks.
