## **The Problem with Dimensionality Reduction in Metabolomics**

Struggling to choose the right dimensionality reduction method for your metabolomics data? You’re not alone. One of the biggest challenges in data analysis is selecting an appropriate technique to handle high-dimensional datasets without losing valuable information. In this post, we’ll dive into practical solutions to make that decision easier and more effective.

## Understanding types of metabolomics studies

Metabolomics research typically serves three primary purposes: **exploration**, **association**, and **prediction**. 

**Exploration** aims to discover patterns in high-dimensional datasets using unsupervised methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques. The **association** category focuses on identifying relationships between metabolites and biological factors, employing statistical methods such as correlation analysis, ANOVA, and linear regression. Lastly, **prediction** involves developing models to classify or predict outcomes based on metabolite profiles, utilizing supervised methods like logistic regression and Random Forest. These classifications guide study design and the selection of appropriate statistical techniques.

## Overview of popular methods in chemometrics analysis

This table provides a comprehensive overview of each method's essential characteristics, facilitating a clearer understanding of their applications and limitations in the context of chemometrics and other fields.

## Criteria to choose a suitable method

**1. Data Type and Structure**

•	**Linear vs. Non-linear Data**:

•	For **linear** relationships, use classical methods like **PCA**, **PLS**, or **FA**.

•	For **non-linear** relationships, opt for methods such as **Kernel PCA**, **t-SNE**, or **autoencoders** to capture complex data structures.

•	**Type of Variables**:

•	**PCA** and **PLS** assume continuous variables. For datasets with categorical variables, consider using **Random Forests** for feature selection prior to dimensionality reduction.

**2. Interpretability**

•	**PCA** and **FA** yield interpretable results, relating components to original variables, making them easier to explain.

•	**NMF** is ideal for interpretable results, particularly when dealing with non-negative components (e.g., concentrations).

•	Although **autoencoders** and **t-SNE** capture complex structures well, they lack interpretability, making them more suitable for visualization.

**3. Goal of the Analysis**

•	**Exploratory Data Analysis**:

•	Use **PCA**, **MDS**, or **t-SNE** to explore data structure and visualize clusters, outliers, and trends.

•	**Feature Selection**:

•	For identifying relevant features (e.g., biomarkers), methods like **sPLS**, **Random Forest**, or **NMF** are preferred.

•	**Noise Filtering**:

•	When dealing with noisy data, techniques like **PLS**, **OPLS**, and **MCR** effectively reduce dimensionality while managing noise.

**4. Scalability and Dataset Size**

•	**Large Datasets**:

•	**PCA**, **PLS**, and **NMF** are computationally efficient for large datasets, suitable for high-dimensional metabolomics data, while non-linear methods like **t-SNE** and **Kernel PCA** may struggle due to computational intensity.

•	**Small Datasets with Many Variables**:

•	For cases with more variables than samples, use methods like **PLS**, **sPLS**, or **OPLS** to prevent overfitting.

**5. Handling of Missing Data**

•	Methods like **PCA** and **PLS** can adapt to missing data through imputation, while techniques like **ICA** require complete data matrices.

•	**NMF** is effective for sparse datasets, provided they remain non-negative.

**6. Assumptions of the Method**

•	**PCA** and **FA** assume normally distributed, linearly related variables; violations may hinder performance.

•	**NMF** requires non-negative data values, making it suitable for specific chemometric applications.

•	**Kernel PCA** and **t-SNE** assume non-linear data structures and are less effective for linear relationships.

**7. Overfitting and Generalization**

•	Supervised methods like **PLS** and **OPLS** are prone to overfitting with small sample sizes; cross-validation is essential for generalizability.

•	Unsupervised methods like **PCA** and **MDS** are less prone to overfitting but may struggle in complex classification tasks.

**8. Dimensionality and Sparsity**

•	For **high-dimensional** and **sparse datasets**, methods like **Sparse PLS (sPLS)** and **NMF** effectively reduce dimensionality and perform feature selection.

•	**Autoencoders** are also suitable for compressing high-dimensional datasets while preserving non-linear structures.
