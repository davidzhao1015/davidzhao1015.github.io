Helping researchers and early HEOR analysts turn microbiome and epidemiological data into defensible, decision-ready quantitative analysis.
</p>

I focus on study design, power analysis, uncertainty, and applied modeling in real-world biomedical research.
Much of this work involves settings with complex, sparse, or imperfect biomedical data, where assumptions need to be made explicit and defensible.

This work is for people who care about transparent assumptions and reproducible workflows.
It is not about black-box methods or one-click answers.
